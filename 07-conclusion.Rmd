# Conclusion

For the 3rd the question we asked, we found that while rich country does use more renewable energy to generate electricity, other countries also extensively use renewable energy to generate electricity. In fact, upper middle and lower middle income countries have been consistenly generating 30% ~ 40% percent of its electricity using renewable energy, while low income country generate close to 50% percent of its electricity in recent years. What does seperate rich countries from them is the use of nuclear energy to generate electricity. Rich countries produce around 10% of its electricity form nuclear energy, while other countries barely use any nuclear energy. This is likely due to the cost and technology barrier to using nuclear energy at scale. 

Additionally, we found there is likely strong negative correlation between the percentage of electricity generated by renewable energy and CO2 emission. In recent years, an increasing percentage of eletricity is being produced by renewable energy in both rich and low income countries, which seems to contribute to the continued drop in CO2 emissions in both countries. Moreover, the least-square lines we fit between percentage of electricity generated by renewable energy and CO2 emission has a obvious downward trend and small standard error, which also indicate a strong negative relationship between use of renewable energy and CO2.
