According to WHO dashboard, there are more than 250 million cumulative cases and more than 5 millions of cumulative deaths because of Covid-19. Not only is the general publics health severely threatened, but the global economy has heavily suffered as well. The world bank dataset reported a record-breaking economy decrease of -3.405% in 2020, worse than that of 2009 when economy crisis reached it climax. Unfortunately, the gap between rich and poor has grown wider during the pandemic as well. According to a report by United States Census Bureau, the poverty rate in US is 11.4% in 2020, up 1.0 percentage point from 2019. This is the first increase in poverty after five consecutive annual declines. In contrast, Forbes worlds billionairs list shows that the number of billionaires on Forbes 35th annual list of the worlds wealthiest exploded to an unprecedented 2,755  660 more than a year ago. It has always been said that education can promote equality, therefore we would like to investigate whether the increase of education attainment and better overall economic condition decrease the income inequality. Another heated topic in recent times has been the Glasgow Climate Change Conference, also known as COP26. Six years after the landmark Paris Climate Agreement, pending items that prevented the full implementation of the accord on carbon markets and transparency, have finally been approved. According to the consensus, the duty to fulfill the pledge of providing 100 billion dollars annually from developed to developing countries was also reaffirmed. This drives us to concentrate the relationship between the development condition of a country and its climate influences. Specifically, we investigate whether there is a co-relation between CO2 and financial indicators, quality of life, etc. to find out whether developed countries contributes more greenhouse emissions. Also, we investigate whether richer countries use more renewable sources for electricity production and if this actually reduces the emission of harmful gases. This will help us determine whether richer countries have actually reduced emissions for electricity production or not. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources As shown in the introduction, we need a wide variety of information, including economic, social welfare, education, greenhouse emissions, electricity production structure etc. Therefore, we found an comprehensive dataset that touches on all of these issues World Development Indicators from the world bank. The data is a collection of development indicators by the world bank, compiled from officially-recognized international sources. It presents the most current and accurate global development data available, and includes national, regional and global estimates. The data set contains several files. WDISeries.csv contains the information about what series are collected, with 1443 records and 20 columns. Each records the information of a series and includes the name of the series, a short code for it, the topic of the series, the source of the series and so on. WDICountry.csv contains the information of countries and regions that are recorded, with 265 rows and 30 columns. Each row represents to a country or region and records the information of its name, region, income group and so on. WDIData.csv contains all the data we may use for every country and every series stated above. Since there is an extra Not classified class for countries, there are in total (265+1) * 1443 = 383838 records. Each row contains the country name and code, the series name and code, and the value since 1960 to 2020, which are 66 columns altogether. When matching the country name of WDICountry.csv and WDIData.csv we found that some names are not the same. There are two reasons that causes the difference: the first one is that WDICountry.csv uses country names with non-ASCII characters, such as Côte d'Ivoire and Curaçao while WDIData.csv transforms them into ASCII characters; another reason is the minor difference in presenting country groups. For example, WDICountry.csv uses IDA &amp; IBRD while WDIData.csv uses IDA &amp; IBRD countries. We manually changed the names in WDICountry.csv to match those in WDIData.csv. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation Importing the data is straight forward using read_csv function in R. We import WDIData.csv, WDISeries.csv and WDICountry.csv as dataframe df_data, df_series and df_countries respectively. Since the country name and series name are repeated to cover every combination, we treat them as factors to ease the operation. First, as stated in the previous section, we match the names of series and countries in df_series and df_countries to that in df_data to avoid any potential mismatching issues. After that, since there are too many kinds of series included in the data set, we put our focus on the series with Topic in the following list that are related to our research: Economic Policy &amp; Debt: National accounts: Adjusted savings &amp; income Economic Policy &amp; Debt: National accounts: US$ at constant 2015 prices: Aggregate indicators Education: Efficiency Education: Outcomes Education: Participation Environment: Emissions Environment: Energy production &amp; use Health: Population: Structure Poverty: Income distribution Poverty: Poverty rates In addition, since there are both country-wise and region-wise data in df_data, we want to concentrate on the country-wise data first, therefore we extract country data in the selected topic as df_countryData_selected. The reduced data set has 217 countries and 279 selected indicators, which leads to a total of 217 * 279 = 60543 rows and remains 66 columns of data. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Missing values by year 4.2 Missing values by indicator 4.3 Missing values by country", " Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Missing values by year We first examine the missing condition in each year. We draw a plot to show the total number of missing values in each year From the figure, we can see that the missing count is segmented roughly in decades. 1960s have the highest missing rate and the recent two years also miss many data. 1970s and 1980 have moderate high missing rate and 2000-2018 have the lowest missing rate. It is interesting to see that the number of missing data drop sharply at around 1990. After looking into the data, the reason lies in the disassembly of the Soviet Union, which adds several countries that doesnt exist in the data set and lead to a fluctuation in records.However, even the lowest missing count is more 20 thousand, almost 1/3 of 60,543 records. Therefore, we concentrate on the time period 1971-2018 and we have to continue to check out the missing condition in each indicator. 4.2 Missing values by indicator We then investigate the difference of missing values by indicators. We draw a plot that shows the distribution of average missing amount in 1970-2018 of each indicator. We can see that there are many high quality indicators that have less than 50 missing values on average. However, there are also many indicators have more than 100 missing values. We drop the indicators that miss more than 150 values on average, since the remaining ones can not support a comprehensive investigation on them. 198 out of 279 selected indicators are left. 4.3 Missing values by country At last, we examine the missing condition in each country.We decide to facet our figure with income group, since the difficulty of data collection differs for countries with different income level. It was a little bit surprising that most of the countries that have high level of missing data are high income countries, which are supposed to have more robust data collecting systems. Luckily, the total number of high income country is large and it doesnt have much influence to remove some of them. Therefore, we only retain the countries that have less than 150 average missing values. After that, 197 out of 217 countries remains. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Does the increase of education attainment and better overall economic condition increase overall well-being of a country? 5.2 Is there a co-relation between CO2 emissions and financial indicators, quality of life, etc? 5.3 Does richer countries use more renewable sources for electricity production and does this indeed reduce the emission of CO2?", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Does the increase of education attainment and better overall economic condition increase overall well-being of a country? Originally, we were going to investigate whether better education attainment and economic condition can decrease income inequality. However, indicators for income distribution, such as Income share held by lowest 20%, Income share held by highest 20%, have a lot of missing values. It seems that only about 30 countries are collecting data for this indicator, making it impossible for us to infer on the general trend worldwide. Therefore, we turn to Life expectancy at birth, total as a substitute since it can reflect the overall well-being of a country. We would first like to investigate the relationship between education attainment and life-expectancy. However, most of the indicators for education attiment have a high percentage of missing values for most countries, again making it difficult for us to infer a general trend. The indicator Primary completion rate, total (% of relevant age group) seems to be the most viable one for analysis of general trend and we further investigate how its missing values are distributed here. We can observe that the number of missing values dropped sharply for all conturies after 1998, which might be attributed to the attention education attainment received in recent years. As a result, we decide to limit our analysis for question to the time period betwen 1999 and 2017. In addition, the rate of values are similar for all four income groups, so dropping countries without any data for this indicator will not lead to a biased distribution between income groups. To investigate on the relationship between education and life expectancy, we first draw a plot between them at year 2010. From the plot, we can see a strong positive correlation between primary completion rate and the life expectancy. Here we need to note that the primary completion rate can be more than 100 since it is the fraction of students enrolled in the last year divided by the students enrolled in the first year. As a result, reapeating students and transfer students will lead to a higher completion rate than expected. Although we can not conclude that higher primary complete rate directly leads to higher life expectancy, we can conclude that they are highly correlated and are both indicators of the overall well-being of a country. After that, we would like to see how primary complete rate and life expectancy have changed over time. From the plot we can see that higher income groups have much higher primary completion rate and life expectancy. High income and upper middle income countries maintains near 100% primary completion rate our window of study, while primary complete rate in lower middle and low income countries grow rapidly thanks to the increasing focus of fundamental education in these areas. 5.2 Is there a co-relation between CO2 emissions and financial indicators, quality of life, etc? We first examine the emission of greenhouse gases per capita for each income group. We choose the year 2000 to draw a boxplot showing the overall distribution. From the plot, we can see the evidence that countries with higher income emit more co2 per person. Most of the low-income countries emit almost negligible co2 compared to high-income countries. However, this might be due to the fact that the production of high-value product requires more energy and low-income countries tend to have bigger population. Therefore, we also plot the relationship between greenhouse emission per 2015 US$ and income groups. This plot gives us some different insight than the former. The plot shows that high and low income countries emit relatively fewer co2 to generate a unit of GDP compared to upper middle and lower middle income countries. The reason may comes from the fact that high-income countries have a wholesome system of service sector that can make a lot of profit with relatively low pollution while the low-income countries focus on fundamental livings which also emit few co2. In contrast, middle-income countries may focus on industrial section, which will emit high amount of co2 for each unit of GDP. At last, we would like see the annually varying situation of the two above-mentioned metrics. We can see that the trend is close to what is shown in the boxplot of CO2 emission per capita, which increases with the increase of income group. We can also observe that the emission per capita in high-income countries drops in the recent years, which may credits to the development of service section and the arise of environment-protect activities. On the other hand, the emission in upper-middle-income countries bursts after 2000, because of the rapid industrialization in these countries. Also, we can observe that the emission of lower-middle-income countries and low-income countries have a cross at about 1990, while the record of upper middle income countries drop sharply at the same time, because the additional data brought by the disassembly of Soviet Union. Similarly, we want to discover how CO2 emission per 2015 US$ has changed over time. From the plot, we can reaffirm our previous observation that middle income countries emits more CO2 to produce a unit of GDP while high-income and low-income emits less. We also see a sharp spike at about 1990 in upper-middle and lower-middle-income countries, which is also due to the dissolution of the Soviet Union. In addition, except for the low-income countries, the world shows a steady drop of CO2 emission per dollar after 1990, owing to the fact that the development of technology can reduce the CO2 emission per product. 5.3 Does richer countries use more renewable sources for electricity production and does this indeed reduce the emission of CO2? We first investigate whether countries with higher income generate more electricity using renewable sources. Here, we define both nuclear sources and all other sources, which includes hydroelectric, solar, wind etc. as renewable sources for electricity production. The indicator we use are the percentage of electricity produced from nuclear sources and percentage of electricity produced from other sources. We then sum them to get the total percentage of electricity produced from renewable sources. We then aggregate them to yearly income group level by taking the mean. Moreover, we limit this analysis to the period between 1990 and 2016, since the indicator contains mostly missing values outside of this date range. We can draw several interesting conclusion from the plot below. Firstly,low income countries have the highest percentage of electricity produced from renewable sources. However, these indicators contains high counts of missing values for low income countries, so this observation might not be robust. Secondly, percentage of electricity produced from renewable sources remains mostly constant for upper middle income countries and exhibit a downward trend for lower middle income countries, while this percentage has been rapidly increasing for high income and low income countries since around 2006. This could be due to increasing awareness of the importance of renewable energy since this period. Third, only rich countries can afford to use nuclear energy as a source of electricity, while this source electricity remains below 5% of total electricity production during this time period for all other countries. To investigate the relationship between use of renewable electricity source and CO2 emission, we first investigate the co-movement between these indicators. Since CO2 emission indicators are respectively in kg and tons, we scale CO2 emission indicators using min max scaling w.r.t each income group so that all indicators in the plot are on similar scales to help with our visualization. For high income countries and low income countries, increase in use of renewable electricity corresponds to a decrease in both indicators for CO2 emission. However, CO2 emissions per capita increase while CO2 per dollar decreased for upper and lower middle income countries, which suggests that other factors, such as productivity increase and/or consumption increase also affects CO2 emissions. We investigate this issue further by visualizing the data at the more granular country level. We created a scatter plot and fit a least square line between renewable electricity percentage and both CO2 emission per capita and CO2 emission per dollar for all income groups. We choose to log CO2 emissions indicators to again account for scale differences. For income groups, there exists a strong negative relationship between renewable electricity percentage and CO2 emission, although the large spread around the least square line indicates that there are other potential explanatory variables for CO2 emission. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component As is shown in the answering the question, for example, in the process of drawing the relationship between primary completion rate and life expectancy, we only plot a figure concentrating on the data of year 2010, since we can not display the data of every year in one figure. With the help of interactive plots, we now have the opportunity to show the data from all years by adding a slide bar to control the year to display. In addition, the radius of the circle represents the population of the country and color shows the income group it belongs to. From the interactive plot, we can see a positive correlation between primary school completion rate and life expectancy in every year. 2018 Hover over a circle to identify the country "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion From the first question we answered, we can see that we change the original topic of income inequality to life expectancy, since the former have too much missing data. Therefore we should have much more detailed investigation on the completeness of the data before start to work. In addition, we found that read_csv from dplyr is much more efficient than read.csv from base package. The former takes almost no time read a file of several hundreds of megabits while the later takes several minutes and more importantly, the later will not be bothered with the data encoding. Hope that the data of income inequality can be completely collected so that we can study on the relation between education attainment and income inequality in the near future. In the second question, we can see that both as a per unit metric, CO2 emission per capita and CO2 emission per 2015 US$ give us completely different image. CO2 emission per capita shows that developed countries emit more greenhouse gases per residence while CO2 emission per 2015 US$ shows that developed countries are more efficient in greenhouse emission on producing unit production. Therefore, this situation gives us a hint that many things can be viewed differently from various perspectives and we should not be stuck to a single opinion. For the 3rd the question we asked, we found that while rich country does use more renewable energy to generate electricity, other countries also extensively use renewable energy to generate electricity. In fact, upper middle and lower middle income countries have been consistenly generating 30% ~ 40% percent of its electricity using renewable energy, while low income country generate close to 50% percent of its electricity in recent years. What does seperate rich countries from them is the use of nuclear energy to generate electricity. Rich countries produce around 10% of its electricity form nuclear energy, while other countries barely use any nuclear energy. This is likely due to the cost and technology barrier to using nuclear energy at scale. Additionally, we found there is likely strong negative correlation between the percentage of electricity generated by renewable energy and CO2 emission. In recent years, an increasing percentage of eletricity is being produced by renewable energy in both rich and low income countries, which seems to contribute to the continued drop in CO2 emissions in both countries. Moreover, the least-square lines we fit between percentage of electricity generated by renewable energy and CO2 emission has a obvious downward trend and small standard error, which also indicate a strong negative relationship between use of renewable energy and CO2.
