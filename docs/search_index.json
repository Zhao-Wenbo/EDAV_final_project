According to WHO dashboard, there are more than 250 millions of cumulative cases and more than 5 millions of cumulative deaths. Not only people’s health is severely threatened, the economy in the whole world is heavily suffered as well. The world bank dataset reported a record-breaking economy decrease of -3.405% in 2020, even worse than that of 2009 when economy crisis reached it climax. Unfortunately, the gap between rich and poor grows wider during the covid-19 pandemic. According to a report by United States Census Bureau, the poverty rate in US is 11.4% in 2020, up 1.0 percentage point from 2019. This is the first increase in poverty after five consecutive annual declines. In contrast, Forbes world’s billionairs list shows that the number of billionaires on Forbes’ 35th annual list of the world’s wealthiest exploded to an unprecedented 2,755 — 660 more than a year ago. It has always been said that education can promote equality, therefore we would like to investigate whether the increase of education attainment and better overall economic condition decrease the income inequality. Another heated topic recently is the held of GLASGOW CLIMATE CHANGE CONFERENCE, also known as COP26. Six years after the historical Paris Agreement, pending items that prevented the full implementation of the Paris Agreement on carbon markets and transparency have finally been approved. According to the consensus, the duty to fulfill the pledge of providing 100 billion dollars annually from developed to developing countries was also reaffirmed. This drives us to concentrate the relationship between the development condition of a country and its climate influences. Specifically, we investigate on whether there is a co-relation between CO2, NOx emissions and financial indicators, quality of life, etc. to find out whether developed countries contributes more greenhouse emissions. Also, we investigate on whether richer countries use more renewable sources for electricity production and does this indeed reduce the emission of CO2 and NOx, to find out whether richer countries has made effort in reducing emission in electricity production.
