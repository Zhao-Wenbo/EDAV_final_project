The size of data set is now ## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): 找不到对象&#39;df_lite&#39; 4.2 Missing values by column We first check the number of missing values in every column. ## Error in is.data.frame(x): 找不到对象&#39;df_lite&#39; From the result, we can see that Country.Name and Indicator.Name are fully filled while the values of indicators in each years have many deficiencies. Especially, we the values in early years such as 1960 are missed for almost all cases. This means that we should limit the analysis interval to recent decades to avoid heavily missing data. 4.3 Missing values in Individual Indicators After that, we check the number of missing values in each individual indicator. ## [1] &quot;Access to electricity (% of population)&quot; ## Error in filter(., Indicator.Name == indicator): 找不到对象&#39;df_lite&#39; We can see that the missing conditional among various indicators vary greatly. For example, Access to electricity (% of population) indicator is missing for most countries before 1980s and are recorded after 2000s. Also, CO2 emissions (metric tons per capita) indicator is complete for most of the countries, which makes it a good analysis target. 4.4 Missing values by country At last, we inspect the missing condition for each country. We count the number of missing indicators at each selected time. ## Error in data.frame(.): 找不到对象&#39;df_lite&#39; ## Error in factor(df_lite$Country.Name): 找不到对象&#39;df_lite&#39; ## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): 找不到对象&#39;df_lite&#39; ## Error in select(., -Indicator.Name): 找不到对象&#39;df_lite_isna&#39; ## Error in cbind(., data.frame(mean_missing = rowMeans(missing_country[, : 找不到对象&#39;missing_country&#39; ## Error in head(missing_country, 5): 找不到对象&#39;missing_country&#39; We can see that some countries missed more than 19 indicators out of 21 selected ones. We should choose those countries with high filling percentage as our research target.
